COMMENT/POSTAMBLE:
Reason for the specific restriction in 3.1.: 
   Some publishers use [our] code without permission commercially, with [excessive] adware/spyware. 
Together they can have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well. 
Thus we rationally/responsibly have to care.
 - Despite of the tendency for smart behavior, to be superior on a long-term, as assumed by licences like GNU, 
(Marketing / competition / economy are just not fair in the present.  Billions of users might not review every software choice)
(And for this project we can't imagine, that requiring to ask first will hinder any good cause but only help/motivate/inspire each other)
